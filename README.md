# Astro Tutorial: Blog
Building a blog following Astro's tutorial. 

Includes:
1. file-based routing across main pages (home, about, and tags),
2. use of layouts for DRYness
3. styling (both globally-scoped and local)
4. content collections for blog posts, including querying all blog posts for its tags
5. filtering blog posts based on tags, each tag having a dynamically-generated page (eg `/tags/astro` would be all the blog posts with the tag `'astro'` in it)
6. integration of Preact component (`Greeting.jsx`)

and others.

Excludes: RSS feeds because I don't really need that for what I'm trying to build with Astro right now
